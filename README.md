# Github Generator

## The Short Version:
This code allows you to use node.js in order to create a portfolio html page for your team of employees.

## More in-depth user control:
 * User is prompted in the CLI to give their role, name, email, school, github or office
 * This choice is then used to generate a card on the html page for the employee
 * fs is utilised to generate the html for the file that display the entire team
